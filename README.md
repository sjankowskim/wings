Wings mod for Blade & Sorcery

## How to Use
Download **Visual Studio Community** from the official Microsoft website and **Git** so you can run `git` commands.

Open your command prompt, navigate to a suitable directory, then run `git clone <link>` and replace `<link>` with the link obtained by clicking the green **Code** button at the top-right of the repository webpage. 

You should now have a local copy of the source code that you can view & edit using your downloaded Visual Studio Community!
